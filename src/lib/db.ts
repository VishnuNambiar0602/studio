// This file is intentionally left to represent a database connection.
// For the purpose of this mock environment, we are not connecting to a real database.
// The actions in `src/lib/actions.ts` will use data from `src/lib/mock-data.ts`.

// In a real application, this file would be configured with Drizzle ORM and a database client like `postgres`.
// For example:
/*
import { drizzle, type NodePgDatabase } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
import postgres from 'postgres';
import * as schema from './schema';

const connectionString = process.env.POSTGRES_URL;

if (!connectionString) {
  throw new Error("POSTGRES_URL environment variable is not set.");
}

const client = postgres(connectionString);
export const db: NodePgDatabase<typeof schema> = drizzle(client, { schema });
*/

// For now, we export a null object to satisfy type imports where needed.
export const db = null;
